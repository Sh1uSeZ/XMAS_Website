# 🎁 Candy Canes Clicker made by Shu

A gamified "Strategic Acquisition Campaign" built for a very specific stakeholder (my brother) to secure a copy of **Monster Hunter Wilds**.

## 🚀 The Mission
This isn't just a clicker game; it’s a high-conversion marketing funnel. As a **Software Engineering Student** with a $0 budget, I have traded my gaming hours for coding hours to prove my dedication to the hunt.

## 🎮 Game Features
* **The Present 🎁:** A high-performance clicking engine. Click to generate Candy Canes.
* **The "Juicy" Bounce:** Custom CSS animations for a tactile, responsive clicking experience.
* **Endless Growth:** Infinite scaling for both clicking power and auto-generation. The more you buy, the more it costs—just like real-world inflation.
* **SaaS-Style UI:** Toggleable side panels (Left/Right) for **Upgrades** and the **Shop**, plus a bottom-docked **Backpack** inventory (Minecraft-style).
* **The Software Student Clause:** This contract strictly excludes manual labor (chores) but guarantees 100% Hunting Horn support in-game.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), and Vanilla JavaScript.
* **UI/UX:** One-page application with toggleable modal windows.
* **Effects:** Canvas-based snowfall and CSS keyframe animations.
* **Deployment:** Hosted on **Vercel** for 99.9% uptime (essential for the Pitch).
* **Intelligence:** Developed with AI assistance for learning complex UI toggles, snowfall effects, and optimization logic.

## 📜 The "Final Offer"
Deep within the backpack lies the **Letter to Santa**. Once the "Support Little Software Engineer" milestone is reached and the letter is unlocked, the final proposal is revealed. 

> **ROI:** 1 Happy Sibling + 1 Dedicated Support Player for 100+ hours.

## 🕹️ Instructions for the Brother (The Stakeholder)
1.  Navigate to the `.vercel.app` link.
2.  Click the present to generate initial capital.
3.  Invest in "Marketing Automation" (Upgrades) to scale your Candy Cane production.
4.  Purchase the "Support little software engineer student" asset.
5.  Unlock the "Letter to Santa" and **Approve the Budget**.
